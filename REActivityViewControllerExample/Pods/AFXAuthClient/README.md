# AFXAuthClient

[AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) Extension for XAuth Authentication.

## Requirements
* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher / Mac OS X 10.7 or higher
* ARC

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `AFXAuthClient` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.15.2** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add AFXAuthClient:

``` bash
pod 'AFXAuthClient', '~> 1.0.8'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `AFXAuthClient` files into your project, and add `#include "AFXAuthClient.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

Here's the sample code that works with Tumblr XAuth:

``` objective-c
AFXAuthClient *client = [[AFXAuthClient alloc] initWithBaseURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://api.tumblr.com"]
                                                                                key:@"YOUR TUMBLR CONSUMER KEY"
                                                                             secret:@"YOUR TUMBLR CONSUMER SECRET"];

[client authorizeUsingXAuthWithAccessTokenPath:@"/oauth/access_token"
                                  accessMethod:@"POST"
                                      username:@"YOUR TUMBLR USERNAME"
                                      password:@"YOUR TUMBLR PASSWORD"
                                       success:^(AFXAuthToken *accessToken) {
                                           NSLog(@"Success = %@", accessToken);

                                           // Now let's request profile information
                                           //
                                           NSMutableURLRequest *request = [client requestWithMethod:@"POST" path:@"/v2/user/info" parameters:nil];
                                           AFJSONRequestOperation *operation = [AFJSONRequestOperation JSONRequestOperationWithRequest:request success:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, id JSON) {
                                               NSLog(@"Info: %@", JSON);
                                           } failure:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSError *error, id JSON) {
                                               NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
                                           }];
                                           [client enqueueHTTPRequestOperation:operation];
                                       } failure:^(NSError *error) {
                                           NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
                                       }];
```
