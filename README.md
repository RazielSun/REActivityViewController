# REActivityViewController

> Without standart activities (Use only for create custom)

## Requirements
* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC

## Installation

Edit your Podfile and add `REActivityViewController`:

``` bash
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'REActivityViewController', :git => 'https://github.com/RazielSun/REActivityViewController.git'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Add `#include "REActivityViewController.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

### Manual installation

`REActivityViewController` needs to be linked with the following frameworks:

* QuartzCore
* AssetsLibrary
* MessageUI
* Twitter

The following framework must be added as optional (weak reference):

* Social

Dependencies:

* [REComposeViewController](https://github.com/romaonthego/REComposeViewController) ~> 2.1.2

## Customization

All views are exposed for your customization. Say, you want to change controller background and customize cancel button, here is how you would do it:

``` objective-c
REActivityViewController *activityViewController = [[REActivityViewController alloc] initWithViewController:self activities:activities];

activityViewController.activityView.backgroundImageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"My_Cool_Background"];
[activityViewController.activityView.cancelButton setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"My_Cool_Button"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
```

Your custom activity icons must be 118x118 pixels and should include gloss, rounded corners and shadows. Easy way to make them:

1. Open your 114x114 icon with rounded corners in Photoshop (you can convert your square icon using template from http://appicontemplate.com).
2. Adjust canvas size to be 118x118, so the top part of the icon touches top part of the canvas.
3. Add drop shadow to the icon layer: angle 90, opacity 40%, distance 2px, size 2px.
